# Intro
- This project uses YOLOv11/YOLOv8 combined with BoT-SORT tracker to:

- Detect and track vehicles in traffic videos.

- Count vehicles going IN (green) and OUT (red) when crossing a detection line.

- Assign a unique ID only when a vehicle touches the line.

- Provide detailed statistics by vehicle type (car, motorbike, truck, etc.).

- Display a clean dashboard overlay directly on the video.

- Save the processed output video automatically.
